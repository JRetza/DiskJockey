# Conventions

We are using the following parameter conventions: inclination ranges from 0 to 180 degrees. 0 degrees means face on, angular momentum vector pointing at observer; 90 means edge on; and 180 means face on, angular momentum vector pointing away from observer. These are the same as the RADMC-3D conventions.

We also adopt the RADMC-3D convention for position angle, which defines position angle by the angular momentum vector. A positive PA angle means the disk angular momentum vector will be rotated counter clockwise (from North towards East).
