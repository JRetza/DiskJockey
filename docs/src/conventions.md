# Conventions

## Inclination

Disk inclination ranges from 0 to 180 degrees. 0 degrees means face on, angular momentum vector pointing at observer; 90 means edge on; and 180 means face on, angular momentum vector pointing away from observer. These are the same as the RADMC-3D conventions and the typical conventions in the astrometric orbital field: inclination < 90 means counter-clockwise rotation and inclination > 90 means clockwise rotation.


## Position Angle

We adopt the RADMC-3D convention for position angle, which defines position angle by the angular momentum vector. A positive PA angle means the disk angular momentum vector will be rotated counter clockwise (from North towards East). 

The convention used by DiskJockey and RADMC-3D is 90 degrees offset from the convention frequently used in the orbital field, which defines position angle using the ascending node, ``\Omega``. For disks, the ascending node is the redshifted portion of the disk major axis (see [Czekala et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...883...22C/abstract) for a discussion).
