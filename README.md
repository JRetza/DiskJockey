This package derives dynamical masses for T Tauri stars using the Keplerian motion of their circumstellar disks, applied to radio interferometric data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA). **If you use this code or a derivative of it in your research, we would really appreciate it if you cited the first paper in our series, [Czekala et al. 2015 ApJ, 806 154C](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...806..154C).**
